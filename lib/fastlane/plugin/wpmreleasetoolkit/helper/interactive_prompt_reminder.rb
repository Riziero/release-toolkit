  # NOTE: FastlaneCore::UI delegates to the FastlaneCore::Shell implementation when output is the terminal
  class Shell
    # Calls the block given and remind the user with a vocal message if the block does not return after specific delays.
    #
    # Especially useful when using a block which calls methods that are interactive, in order to remind the user
    # to answer the interactive prompt if they forgot about it after some delays.
    #
    # Example usage:
    #
    #       text = with_reminder do
    #         puts "Enter some text:"
    #         $stdout.getch
    #       end
    #
    # @param [Double,Array<Double>] after
    #        Delay or list of delays to wait for before pronouncing the reminder message.
    #        If an array of values is passed, the message will be pronounced multiple times, after having waited for the subsequent delays in turn.
    #        Defaults to reminding after 30s, then 3mn, then 10mn.
    # @param [String] message
    #        The message to pronounce out loud after the delay has passed, if the block hasn't returned beforehand.
    # @return The same value that the blocks might return
    #

    # Once you call this method, any invocation of `UI.input`, `UI.confirm`, `UI.select` or `UI.password`
    # anywhere in Fastlane (by your Fastfile, an action, â€¦) will be wrapped in a call to with_reminder automatically.
